    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A applications using the Retrieve API provide by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, along with LangChain and Ragas for evaluating the responses. Here, we will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search, prompt the query using Anthropic Claude, and then evaluate the responses effectively using evaluation metrics, such as faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_recall, context_precision, context_entity_recall, answer_similarity, answer_correctness, harmfulness, maliciousness, coherence, correctness and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With knowledge bases, you can securely connect foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock to your company\n",
    "data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Access to additional data helps the model generate more relevant,\n",
    "context-speciﬁc, and accurate responses without continuously retraining the FM. All information retrieved from\n",
    "knowledge bases comes with source attribution to improve transparency and minimize hallucinations. For more information on creating a knowledge base using console, please refer to this [post](!https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement the solution using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. Here, we are performing RAG effectively on a knowledge base we will create as part of this lab. \n",

    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our notebook we will use the `Retrieve API` provided by Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock which converts user queries into\n",
    "embeddings, searches the knowledge base, and returns the relevant results, giving you more control to build custom\n",
    "workﬂows on top of the semantic search results. The output of the `Retrieve API` includes the the `retrieved text chunks`, the `location type` and `URI` of the source data, as well as the relevance `scores` of the retrievals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the text chunks being generated and augment it with the original prompt and pass it through the `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will evaluate the generated responses using RAGAS on using metrics such as faithfulness, answer relevancy,and context precision. For evaluation, we will use `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`.\n",
    "### Ask question\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "1. Utilize RAGAS for evaluation on:\n",
    "    1. **Faithfulness:** This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "    2. **Answer Relevance:** The evaluation metric, Answer Relevancy, focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information and higher scores indicate better relevancy. This metric is computed using the question, the context and the answer. Please note, that eventhough in practice the score will range between 0 and 1 most of the time, this is not mathematically guaranteed, due to the nature of the cosine similarity ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "    3. **Context Precision:** Context Precision is a metric that evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. This metric is computed using the question, ground_truth and the contexts, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "    4. **Context Recall:** Context recall measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. It is computed based on the ground truth and the retrieved context, and the values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "    5. **Context entities recall:** This metric gives the measure of recall of the retrieved context, based on the number of entities present in both ground_truths and contexts relative to the number of entities present in the ground_truths alone. Simply put, it is a measure of what fraction of entities are recalled from ground_truths. This metric is useful in fact-based use cases like tourism help desk, historical QA, etc. This metric can help evaluate the retrieval mechanism for entities, based on comparison with entities present in ground_truths, because in cases where entities matter, we need the contexts which cover them.\n",
    "    6. **Answer Semantic Similarity:** The concept of Answer Semantic Similarity pertains to the assessment of the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer, with values falling within the range of 0 to 1. A higher score signifies a better alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "    7. **Answer Correctness:** The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness. Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity. These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score. Users also have the option to employ a ‘threshold’ value to round the resulting score to binary, if desired.\n",
    "    8. **Aspect Critique:** This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness and correctness. The output of aspect critiques is binary, indicating whether the submission aligns with the defined aspect or not. This evaluation is performed using the ‘answer’ as input.\n",
