# ragas-lab


Run the cloudformation template cfn.yaml
Name it something short like "rag". If the name is too long it will affect the character limits of the created IAM Roles and will cause errors in the labs. 
Open the created Sagemaker Studio Domain Studio Classic instance. The labs will be automatically downloaded to the sagemaker classic notebook as part of the cfn execution.
